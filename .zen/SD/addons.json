With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n    Protect your browsing activity in individual Containers using Mozilla VPN, so you can shop while travelling abroad but check your bank account from a server in your home country.\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nFor more information on how to use Multi-Account Containers, visit our help articles:\n\n\nAll about Multi Account Containers\nMulti

If you still have problems after updating to 2.13.2, make sure that the native version mentioned in the extension settings (About the project) is also 2.13.2. If it's not, uninstall the native program from the system settings and try again. If everything is updated to 2.13.2 but you still have problems, please run \"Patch profiles and runtime\" from the extension settings.\n\nProgressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use web APIs and features along with progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. Although Firefox supports many of Progressive Web App APIs, it does not support functionality to install them as a standalone system app with an app-like experience. This functionality is often also known as a Site Specific Browser (SSB).\n\nThis project creates a custom modified Firefox runtime to allow websites to be installed as standalone apps and provides a console tool and browser extension to install, manage and use them.\n\nYou can check out the installation and usage instructions on our documentation website. You can also check out the project's source code and more information on the GitHub repository.\n\nNote: I will appreciate it if you read and participate in a GitHub discussion to suggest how to make this project more user-friendly and which features would you like the most. You can also read and participate in a GitHub discussion about the documentation website.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258556.png?modified=1689538600","width":678,"height":918,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258556.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":295,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Installing sites as a PWAs with just a few clicks"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258557.png?modified=1689538600","width":661,"height":864,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258557.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":306,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Managing and launching installed sites from your browser"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258572.png?modified=1689538600","width":652,"height":862,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258572.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":303,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Organizing sites into different profiles for multiple instances of the same site"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258573.png?modified=1689538600","width":1204,"height":971,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258573.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":496,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Launching installed sites directly from your operating system"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/258/258558.png?modified=1689538600","width":2290,"height":1756,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/258/258558.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":522,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Opened sites will have their own window with separate taskbar icon and group for a better app-like experience"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/259/259934.png?modified=1689538600","width":2400,"height":1244,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/259/259934.jpg?modified=1689538600","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":276,"caption":"The project supports most major operating systems and desktop environments"}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox","supportURL":"https://pwasforfirefox.filips.si/","contributionURL":"https://github.com/sponsors/filips123?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.5528,"reviewCount":128,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":443,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4383345/pwas_for_firefox-2.13.1.xpi","updateDate":1731662591000},{"id":"{1c5e4c6f-5530-49a3-b216-31ce7d744db0}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2641/2641778-32.png?modified=4bd8cbda","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2641/2641778-64.png?modified=4bd8cbda","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2641/2641778-128.png?modified=4bd8cbda"},"type":"extension","name":"MarkDownload - Markdown Web Clipper","version":"3.2.0","creator":{"name":"death.au","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/49564/"},"developers":[],"description":"This extension works like a web clipper, but it downloads articles in a markdown format.

Please keep in mind that it is not guaranteed to work on all websites.\n\nTo use this add-on, simply click the add-on icon while you are browsing the page you want to save offline. A popup will show the rendered markdown so you can make minor edits or copy the text, or you can click the download button to download an .md file.\nSelecting text will allow you to download just the selected text\n\nContext Menus\nYou can also right-click on pages, images, links and selections to copy or download snippets of Markdown.\nYou can also download all tabs in a window as Markdown files\n\nObsidian Integration\nFor integration with obsidian, you need to install and enable community plugins named \"Advanced Obsidian URI\". This plugin help us to bypass character limitation in URL. Because it's using clipboard as the source for creating new file.\nMore information: https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/\n\nExternal Libraries\nIt uses the following libraries:\n\n- Readability.js by Mozilla in version from commit by Mozilla version 0.5.0. This library is also used for the Firefox Reader View and it simplifies the page so that only the important parts are clipped. (Licensed under Apache License Version 2.0)\n- Turndown by Dom Christie in version 7.1.3 is used to convert the simplified HTML (from Readability.js) into markdown. (Licensed under MIT License)\n- Moment.js version 2.29.4 used to format dates in template variables\n\nPermissions\n- Data on all sites: used to enable \"Download All Tabs\" functionality - no other data is captured or sent online\n- Access tabs: used to access the website content when the icon in the browser bar is clicked.\n- Manage Downloads: necessary to be able to download the markdown file.\n- Storage: used to save extension options\n- Clipboard: used to copy Markdown to clipboard\n\nPricing\nHuh? This is an open-source extension I made for fun. It's completely free.
